An exploration of some of the most recent research into our understanding of how Life's most important biological processes may be highly dependent on quantum phenomena.  Photosynthesis, cellular respiration, enzymes, the brain & consciousness, genetics & evolution... Life's key features possibly utilizing quantum effects like tunneling and superposition to achieve a higher level of efficiency and order than can be accounted for by thermodynamic laws alone.  The keyword is *possibly* since much of this research is very new and scientists are only just beginning to elucidate the relationship between the mechanics of Life and quantum theory.

# A Brief Summary of Quantum Phenomena
Quantum mechanics describes the behavior of atomic and subatomic particles: protons, electrons, etc.  These atomic structures behave in unintuitive, often magical-seeming, ways.  The growing field of quantum biology seeks to identify the ways in which Life has taken advantage of quantum phenomena to achieve the structures and processes which allow Life to exist.  Thus, a quick re
## Wave-Particle Duality
Similarly to how light behaves like a wave yet is also composed of particles called photons, all atomic structures also exhibit both wave- and particle-like behavior.  Atomic particles exist in a purely wave
