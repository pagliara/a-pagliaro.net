> "What I cannot create, I do not understand" - [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman)  

An exploration of recent research into how some of *Life*'s most important biological processes and structures may be highly dependent on quantum phenomena.  Photosynthesis, cellular respiration, enzymes, the brain & consciousness, genetics & evolution... *Life* utilizes quantum effects like tunneling and superposition to achieve a higher level of efficiency and order than can be accounted for by thermodynamic laws alone.  Much of this research is very new and scientists are only just beginning to elucidate the relationship between the mechanics of *Life* and quantum theory.

## A Brief Summary of Quantum Phenomena
[Quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics) describes the behavior of atomic and subatomic particles: protons, electrons, etc.  These atomic structures behave in unintuitive ways.  The growing field of quantum biology seeks to identify the ways in which *Life* has taken advantage of quantum phenomena to achieve the structures and processes which allow it to exist.
### Wave-Particle Duality
The [de Broglie hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter_wave#The_de_Broglie_hypothesis) proposes all matter can have both wave- and particle-like behavior.  The infamous [Double Slit Experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment) illustrates this duality.  The consequences of this phenomenon are currently subject to much debate amongst quantum physicists; specifically, how should we interpret this duality in the real physical world?  What does it mean to behave as both a wave *and* a particle?  Quantum theory has developed a multitude of [interpretations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics#Summary_of_common_interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics).
### Tunneling
[Tunneling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_tunnelling) represents the most fundamental process in physics.<sup>1</sup>  This phenomenon allows particles to "tunnel" through an energy barrier despite not having the required energy to do so according to classical physics.
>Physicists introduced the name tunneling for a classical forbidden process, which the theory of quantum mechanics explained around 1927: A ball, for instance, can- not overcome a hill if its kinetic energy is less than the hill’s gravitational potential energy. In this case the ball rolls back. However, quantum mechanics explained that the ball has a tiny probability of getting to the other side of the hill. Similarly, an α-particle leaves the attractive nuclear potential well despite having a small energy, thereby producing radioactivity.<sup>1</sup> - Tunneling, *Compendium of Quantum Physics*

We now understand processes like radioactive decay and nuclear fusion (like the fusion of hydrogen atoms into helium that powers our sun) are possible due to tunneling.  

### Entanglement
[Entanglement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement) allows the quantum states of pairs or groups of particles to be synchronized in such a way that measurement of one particle will be correlated with measurement of the other particles.  This effect occurs instantaneously across any distance in space.  If the state of one particle is known, the state of the other entangled particle, no matter where it is in the universe, is also known.  Entanglement is what Einstein referred to as "spooky action at a distance" and what led him to believe that quantum mechanics was an incomplete model of reality.  See the [EPR paradox](#epr-paradox).

## Enzymes & Respiration
[Enzymes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme) are biological catalysts.  They speed up chemical reactions, sometimes millions of times faster than the reaction could proceed otherwise.  Biological chemical reactions like [cellular respiration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_respiration), in which a highly coordinated transfer of electrons during a sequence of chemical reactions is used to convert chemical energy stored in the bonds of glucose molecules into energy stored in bonds of ATP molecules, a form of cellular fuel, would essentially be impossible without coordination of enzymes.  We evolved lungs to supply oxygen to the final stage of this cascade of reactions, to act as the final electron acceptor to transform O<sub>2</sub> into CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O.  
The puzzle of respiration is how these enzymes are able to transfer electrons so efficiently across what are known to be very large molecular gaps between the enzymes, several tens of angstroms wide (a distance of many atoms).  

In 1966, Don DeVault & Britton Chance published [*Studies of Photosynthesis Using a Pulsed Laser*](http://www.cell.com/biophysj/pdf/S0006-3495(66)86698-5.pdf), the first experimental evidence that enzymes use [quantum tunneling](#tunneling) during electron transfer.  DeVault & Chance found the rate of electron-hopping in respiratory enzymes did not drop at low temperatures.  They measured the rate of electron transfer in cells of a photosynthetic bacterium [Chromatium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatium) using pulses of light from a ruby laser.  They found the rate of transfer decreased steadily with temperature until 35˚K, after which the rate remained constant.  The lack of temperature dependence after 35˚K is evidence of transfer by quantum tunneling.  

It took several years to theoretically explain the temperature results in the DeVault & Chance experiment.  In 1974, J.J. Hopfield published [*Electron Transfer Between Biological Molecules by Thermally Activated Tunneling*](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/cba0/4f5cdaaa98e4ae27420befa50142ee9971f8.pdf), in which he develops a theoretical model for this tunneling that matches the results from the DeVault & Chance experiment.

## Final Thoughts
I really enjoyed this book.  A fantastic introduction to and summary of the concepts of quantum mechanics and the growing field of quantum biology.  Quantum mechanics is mind-boggling at times, yet it remains the most accurate model we have of atomic behavior; the authors do well at presenting these concepts in a digestible way.  Certainly, that mysterious phenomenon *Life* has utilized the quantum nature of this universe; that *Life*, arising consequently from the nature of this universe, should be correlated with that nature is almost obvious.
