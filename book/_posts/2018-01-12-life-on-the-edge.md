An exploration of recent research into how some of *Life*'s most important biological processes and structures may be highly dependent on quantum phenomena.  Photosynthesis, cellular respiration, enzymes, the brain & consciousness, genetics & evolution... *Life* possibly utilizing quantum effects like tunneling and superposition to achieve a higher level of efficiency and order than can be accounted for by thermodynamic laws alone.  The keyword is *possibly* since much of this research is very new and scientists are only just beginning to elucidate the relationship between the mechanics of *Life* and quantum theory.

## A Brief Summary of Quantum Phenomena
[Quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics) describes the behavior of atomic and subatomic particles: protons, electrons, etc.  These atomic structures behave in unintuitive ways.  The growing field of quantum biology seeks to identify the ways in which *Life* has taken advantage of quantum phenomena to achieve the structures and processes which allow it to exist.
### Wave-Particle Duality
The [de Broglie hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter_wave#The_de_Broglie_hypothesis) proposes all matter can have both wave- and particle-like behavior.  The infamous [Double Slit Experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment) illustrates this duality.  The consequences of this phenomenon are currently subject to much debate amongst quantum physicists; specifically, how should we interpret this duality in the real physical world?  What does it mean to behave as both a wave *and* a particle?  Quantum theory has developed a multitude of [interpretations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics#Summary_of_common_interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics).
### Tunneling
[Tunneling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_tunnelling) represents the most fundamental process in physics.<sup>1</sup>  This phenomenon allows particles to "tunnel" through an energy barrier despite not having the required energy to do so according to classical physics.
>Physicists introduced the name tunneling for a classical forbidden process, which the theory of quantum mechanics explained around 1927: A ball, for instance, can- not overcome a hill if its kinetic energy is less than the hill’s gravitational potential energy. In this case the ball rolls back. However, quantum mechanics explained that the ball has a tiny probability of getting to the other side of the hill. Similarly, an α-particle leaves the attractive nuclear potential well despite having a small energy, thereby producing radioactivity.<sup>1</sup> - Tunneling, *Compendium of Quantum Physics*

We now understand processes like radioactive decay and nuclear fusion (like the fusion of hydrogen atoms into helium that powers our sun) are possible due to tunneling.  

### Entanglement
[Entanglement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement) allows the quantum states of pairs or groups of particles to be synchronized in such a way that measurement of one particle will be correlated with measurement of the other particles.  This effect occurs instantaneously across space.  Entanglement is what Einstein referred to as "spooky action at a distance" and what led him to believe that quantum mechanics was an incomplete model of reality.  See the [EPR paradox](#epr-paradox).
