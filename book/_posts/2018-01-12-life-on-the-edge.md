An exploration of recent research into how some of Life's most important biological processes may be highly dependent on quantum phenomena.  Photosynthesis, cellular respiration, enzymes, the brain & consciousness, genetics & evolution... Life possibly utilizing quantum effects like tunneling and superposition to achieve a higher level of efficiency and order than can be accounted for by thermodynamic laws alone.  The keyword is *possibly* since much of this research is very new and scientists are only just beginning to elucidate the relationship between the mechanics of Life and quantum theory.

## A Brief Summary of Quantum Phenomena
Quantum mechanics describes the behavior of atomic and subatomic particles: protons, electrons, etc.  These atomic structures behave in unintuitive, often magical-seeming, ways.  The growing field of quantum biology seeks to identify the ways in which Life has taken advantage of quantum phenomena to achieve the structures and processes which allow Life to exist.
### Wave-Particle Duality
All matter can have both wave- and particle-like behavior.  The infamous [Double Slit Experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment) illustrates this duality effectively.  The consequence of this phenomenon is that the state of any quantum particle such as an electron can be defined by a mathematical equation called a [wave function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function), which describes the probability of finding the electron at a given point in time and space.
### Wave Function Collapse
The quantum particle has no definite position until the particle
